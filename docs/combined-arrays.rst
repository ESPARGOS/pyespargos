Combined Arrays
===============

You can combine multiple ESPARGOS devices with 2 Ã— 4 antennas into one larger phase-synchronous antenna array.
The combined array can be made phase-synchronous across the devices if all ESPARGOS arrays are connected to the same reference signal generator.
This page describes how to configure multiple ESPARGOS devices for phase-coherent operation.
If you don't need phase-coherent operation, there is no need to follow these instructions.

   Four ESPARGOS antenna arrays combined into one larger array, all connected to the same reference signal generator.

*This page will be updated with instructions on how to combine ESPARGOS devices into a larger array in the future.*
