Getting Started
===============

Before you get started with *pyespargos*, please make sure to that your ESPARGOS controller can be reached either via its IP address or a hostname.
In the following examples, we will assume that ESPARGOS controllers are reachable at IP addresses :code:`192.168.1.2`, :code:`192.168.1.3`, :code:`192.168.1.4` and so on,
but you may replace the IP addresses with hostnames if you prefer that.

WiFi Settings
-------------

Before you can capture channel state information (CSI), you must make sure to configure suitable WiFi settings in the `ESPARGOS web interface <https://espargos.net/setup/>`_.
ESPARGOS configuration is persistent across reboots, so you only need to do this once.

Make sure that the following options are configured correctly before using *pyespargos*:

* Set *Generate Phase Reference* to *During calibration*
* Select the correct WiFi country code and make sure that you are allowed to use the desired WiFi channel in your country.
* Select a suitable WiFi primary and secondary channel for your device. Make sure your settings are correct by checking if you can receive CSI from your device (i.e., while "Antenna" is selected as a source) in the *Live CSI* tab.
* You can choose a small calibration signal interval, e.g. 10 milliseconds, then calibration takes less time.

Minimal Example
---------------

The following code example receives clustered CSI from one ESPARGOS device:

.. code-block:: python

   import espargos

   # Connect to ESPARGOS board at IP address 192.168.1.2
   board = espargos.Board("192.168.1.2")

   # Create new ESPARGOS pool with only one board
   pool = espargos.Pool([board])

   # Start CSI reception thread for all board in pool (just one board in this case)
   pool.start()

   # Collect CSI from reference channel for calibration
   pool.calibrate(2)

   # Get a callback whenever CSI for one HT40 packet is available from all antennas.
   # The argument to this function clustered_csi is an instance of the "ClusteredCSI" class.
   def handle_csi(clustered_csi):
       csi_raw = clustered_csi.deserialize_csi_ht40()
       csi_calibrated = pool.get_calibration().apply_ht40(csi_raw)
       print("Got channel coefficients with shape:", csi_calibrated.shape)

   pool.add_csi_callback(handle_csi)

   # Main loop, add your break condition here
   while True:
       pool.run()

   # Stop CSI reception thread
   pool.stop()

The example illustrates the basic usage of the :class:`.Board` and :class:`.Pool` classes:

**The** :class:`.Board` **class** is responsible for handling the connection (i.e., websockets stream for CSI data and HTTP for configuration) to one single ESPARGOS controller.
There are very few reasons to use this class directly.
In application code, you should always - even if only using a single ESPARGOS device - use the :class:`.Pool` class.

**The** :class:`.Pool` **class** is responsible for handling the clustering of CSI from one or multiple ESPARGOS boards.
When the microcontrollers ("sensors") on the ESPARGOS array board receive a WiFi packet, they just forward the CSI estimates to the central controller together with packet metadata like MAC address, timestamp and frame counter.
The controller then forwards the CSI estimates to the computer running *pyespargos*, which is then responsible for figuring out which CSI estimates belong to the same WiFi packet.
This is easy to achieve by finding matching packet metadata.
By default, the CSI callback is only triggered if CSI is available from *all* sensors, but you can change this behavior (see documentation of :func:`~espargos.pool.Pool.add_csi_callback` for details).

An ESPARGOS pool is initialized with a list of objects of the :class:`.Board` class, which can also contain just one entry if you only use a single ESPARGOS device.

With CSI Backlog
----------------
When working with a :class:`.Pool` of ESPARGOS devices, you get a callback whenever there is a new complete CSI cluster.
However, in many cases, you don't care about the instantaneous CSI at this very moment in time, but instead want to operate on the last couple of channel estimates.
This is what the :class:`.CSIBacklog` class is for:
This class collects CSI alongside other data (like timestamps, RSSI) from complete cluster up until a certain predefined size limit is reached.
The application code can query the backlog whenever it needs recent CSI.

.. code-block:: python

  import espargos
  import time

  pool = espargos.Pool([espargos.Board("192.168.1.2")])
  pool.start()
  pool.calibrate(duration = 2)
  backlog = espargos.CSIBacklog(pool, size = 20)
  backlog.start()

  # Wait for a while to collect some WiFi packets to the backlog...
  time.sleep(4)

  csi_ht40 = backlog.get_ht40()
  print("Received CSI: ", csi_ht40)
