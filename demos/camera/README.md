# Shader Compilation

Before you can run the camera demo, the fragment and vertex shader must be compiled. Usually, the pre-compiled ones found in the repository will work just fine.

Otherwise, use the `compile_shader.sh` (Linux / macOS) or `compile_shader.bat` (Windows) scripts (you may need to adapt the path to `qsb`).
